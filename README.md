## General info
This project is a simple React-Native that fetches a list of movies from the "The Movie Database API" and display a list that contains the title, poster, overview , and the release date of each Movie.

I provide also the Lazy Loading (Infinite Scroll) functionality that fetches the next page of content once the user reaches the end of the FlatList.
